# Reddit-save-submissions
That script would save submission's media (currently only photos) from multiple users cocurrently. In addition, it alerts the user whenever media was found \ saved.


Basically, the script is very simple, and all the user has to do is enter the REDDIT USERS he wants the script to follow, and the REDDIT USER he wants to notify whenever media is found.

The script is super simple and highly self-explainatory, but if you need any help understanding it, feel free to hit me up
